# EDA-for-global-terrorism-dataset
"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Repository: In-depth data exploration and visualization of Global Terrorism Dataset Using Google Colab Internet Python Notebook."

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a global terrorism dataset. The dataset used in this analysis provides information about terrorist incidents worldwide, including details such as the location, date, perpetrator information, and attack type.

## Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Global_Terrorism_Database
- **Source:** (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zSc5gUgGurOlcQIFWTJ7nUsROpxvfRAH/view?usp=drive_link)

## Files Included
1. 'Numerical_Python_Capston_project_Final.ipynb' - Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA code.
2. `README.md` - Documentation file providing information about the project.

## Installation and Setup
- First you have to download the dataset from the given link and then upload this file to the google drive.
-  Copy the path of the global_terrorist_dataset.csv file from the google drive and paste it in the google colab to perfrorm EDA

## Usage
Open the Numerical_Python_Capston_project_Final.ipynb Jupyter Notebook .
Run each cell sequentially to perform the EDA.

## EDA Highlights
The EDA covers the following key aspects:

## Data Cleaning:
 Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
## Descriptive Statistics: 
 Summarizing key statistics and information about the dataset.
## Temporal Analysis:  
 Examining trends and patterns over time.
## Geospatial Analysis: 
 Visualizing terrorist incidents on a world map.
## Attack Types and Targets: 
 Analyzing the distribution of attack types and targeted entities.
 
## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings from the EDA and potential insights gained from the analysis.
